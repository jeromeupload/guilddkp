* /gddkp playername                     - for requesting DKP status of playername | default playername is own name
* /gdaddraid int:amount                 - for adding int:amount of DKP to entire raid | no default
* /gdadd playername int:amount          - for adding int:amount to playername | no default
* /gdminus playername int:amount        - for subtracting int:amount from playername | no default
* /gdclass class                        - for getting top 10 players and their dkp standing | default class is own class  
Please see [issue 6](https://github.com/CasperGN/guilddkp/issues/6) about the below commands
